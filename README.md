🐾 Adopto

✨ “Because every paw matters.” ✨

✨ Description

Welcome to Adopto — the luxury-styled Pet Adoption Platform 🐶🐱.
This is a full-stack application built with the MERN stack, where users can:

Explore adorable pets looking for their forever homes

Save favorites (because let’s be honest, choosing one is impossible)

Manage their adoption profile

Experience a smooth and stylish interface inspired by editorial design

This project was created with ❤️ by Daniela Delgado & Larissa Santos as our final project at Ironhack WDPT 20250408 RMT-EN.

More than code, it’s about compassion. More than a CRUD, it’s about giving every paw a chance.

🧠 Technologies Used

- Frontend: React + Vite (SPA, AuthContext, custom styling)
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js (REST API)
- Database: MongoDB + Mongoose
- Auth: JWT (signup/login, password encryption)
- Deployment: Netlify (frontend), Render (backend)
- Other tools: Git, GitHub, npm, Agile rituals ☕

👩‍💻 Team

✨ Larissa Lucio dos Santos
✨ María Daniela Delgado

We worked as a true team, following Agile practices:

- Daily standups ☕
- Sprint planning & retrospectives 📋
- Pair programming & debugging marathons 💻

Yes, there were merge conflicts. Yes, there was coffee. A lot of it.
But in the end, we built something we’re proud of.

💡 Inspiration

Because adopting a pet changes more than one life.
Adopto is our way of showing how technology can create bridges between shelters and adopters.

At the end of the day…
✨ every paw matters ✨
